!!!summary "Abstract"
    The problem of approximating the response of
    the ideal frequency-selective transfer-function in both the time
    and frequency domain represents a fundamental limitation in
    linear systems theory. In this paper, we propose the uniformly-
    damped binomial filter (UDBF) transfer-function as a better
    and balanced solution to this approximation problem in the
    time and frequency domain, than both the butterworth filter
    and the binomial filter. This class of filter can be viewed
    as a general approach to realize, in any integer order, a
    binomial filter transfer-function with an approximate maximum
    complementary-sensitivity and transient response similar to the
    standard second-order butterworth filter. We further demon-
    strate that this uniformly-damped binomial response overcomes
    both the excessive ringing phenomena associated with the
    butterworth response, and the sluggish response associated with
    the binomial response for higher order transfer-functions. We
    conclude that the uniformly-damped binomial standard form
    response is a viable replacement for both the butterworth and
    binomial forms in applications of interest, where strong filtering
    and a smooth transient response is desired.
